 is not really what we need. We have made `shared` as global mutable state just to
 enable our test logic. Nothing wrong with subclass but there is better approach
 such as composition. To use composition we inject this type into `RemoteFeedLoader`
 
 This is an abstract class but in Swift we have protocol to define a interface like this

 do not need to locate and it can just whatever is given to it.
